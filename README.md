# Library

## [Live preview of the project](https://nikolhurd.github.io/library/) <br>

Project "Library" is one of the projects in The Odin Project, JavaScript Course.
You can find more about the Assigment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).

This project allows users to manage a collection of books, providing functionality to add, display, and remove books, as well as toggle the read status of each book.

I utilized JavaScript concepts such as object constructors, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
